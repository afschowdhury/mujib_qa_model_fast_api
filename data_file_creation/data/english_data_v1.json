This Purnachandra Das was a colleague of revolutionary Bagha Jatin. Rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam wrote a poem about him. That poem named 'Poorna Abhinandan' was published in the famous 'Bhangar Gan' poetry book of 1924. In his autobiography, Bangabandhu also said that he started traveling regularly to the meetings of the Swadeshi in Madaripur and Gopalganj. As a result, he gradually became an ardent opponent of British rule and became a devotee of Subhash Chandra Bose. Also Bangabandhu's tutor was an anti-British activist named Hamid Master.

Even as an important student leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became indispensable in the politics of Dhaka by reading the resolutions adopted in the conference committee. Sheikh Mujib took part in the signature collection campaign for the demand of Bengali language with Rashtrabhasa Sangram Parishad and regularly participated in various meetings and marches. On December 5, during the meeting of the Muslim League Working Committee at Khawaja Nazimuddin's residence, he took a procession there demanding Bengali as the state language. In December of the same year, 14 linguists, including contemporary politicians, formulated a manifesto with 21-point demands including the first language-movement and other demands. It was published in the form of a small booklet, titled 'Rashtra Bhasha-21 Point Manifesto - Historical Document'.

Also, he was again arrested by the government of Pakistan for becoming the main organizer of the language movement. As a result, from September 11, 1948 to January 21, 1949, from April 19 to June 28, 1949, from October 25 to December 27, 1949, he had to go to jail. But because of his tireless work to spread the language movement across the country after being released, he was arrested on December 31, 1949 and kept in jail till February 27, 1952 by the government of Pakistan.At that time, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was established as the leader of Awami League. He regularly gave directions to the language movement through the leaders of the Chhatra League even from jail. As a result, he was sent to Faridpur Jail from Dhaka. On February 16, 1952, while going to Faridpur, he sent a note to several leaders of the Chhatra League and instructed them to make the February 21 movement a success. He even started a hunger strike in prison. Bangabandhu was released on February 27 due to illness.",
